# HashTable (HashMap) in Dart

## Overview

Welcome to the "HashTable in Dart" section of our Dart Data Structures and Algorithms repository! In this section, we delve into the HashTable implementation, exploring the fundamental concepts of hashing, collision handling, load factor, and rehashing.

## HashTable

A HashTable is a powerful data structure that facilitates fast and efficient data retrieval. It operates on the principle of hashing, where a hash function transforms keys into numerical indices, allowing for direct access to stored values.

## Implementation Concepts in HashTable

The Dart implementation of the HashTable is encapsulated in the `HashTable` class, found in the hash_table.dart file. Here's a breakdown of key elements:

### Hashing

- **Hash Function:** The hash function used here converts a key into a hash code, determining the index where the corresponding value will be stored.
  
### Collision Handling

- **Chaining:** Collisions, when two keys hash to the same index, are managed through a chaining mechanism. Each index in the array holds a linked list of elements that share the same hash.

### Load Factor and Rehashing

- **Load Factor:** The load factor is the ratio of stored elements to the size of the array. If it exceeds a threshold, rehashing occurs to resize the array and maintain efficiency.

## Implementation Details

The Dart implementation of the HashTable is encapsulated in the `HashTable` class, found in the hash_table.dart file. 
Here's a breakdown of key elements:

### Operations

The `HashTable` class supports the following operations:

- `add`: Add a key-value pair to the HashTable.
- `remove`: Remove a key-value pair from the HashTable.
- `get`: Retrieve the value associated with a given key.
- `getAll`: Retrieve all elements in the HashTable.
- `update`: Update the value associated with a given key.
