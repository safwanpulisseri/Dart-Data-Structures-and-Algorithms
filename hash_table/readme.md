# HashTable (HashMap) in Dart

## Overview

Welcome to the "HashTable in Dart" section of our Dart Data Structures and Algorithms repository! In this section, we delve into the HashTable implementation, exploring the fundamental concepts of hashing, collision handling, load factor, and rehashing.

## HashTable Concepts

### What is a HashTable?

A HashTable, also known as HashMap, is a powerful data structure that facilitates fast and efficient data retrieval. It operates on the principle of hashing, where a hash function transforms keys into numerical indices, allowing for direct access to stored values.

### Hashing

- **Hash Function:** The hash function used here converts a key into a hash code, determining the index where the corresponding value will be stored.

### Collision Handling

- **Chaining:** Collisions, which occur when two keys hash to the same index, are managed through a chaining mechanism. Each index in the array holds a linked list of elements that share the same hash.

### Load Factor and Rehashing

- **Load Factor:** The load factor is the ratio of stored elements to the size of the array. If it exceeds a threshold, rehashing occurs to resize the array and maintain efficiency.

## HashTable Representation

In the provided `HashTable` class, we represent the HashTable using an array of linked lists, utilizing a Dart `List`. The indices of the array represent hash codes generated by the hash function, and the corresponding values are linked lists containing key-value pairs associated with each hash code.

### Operations You Can Find in the `hash_table.dart` File:

The `HashTable` class supports the following operations:

- `add`: Add a key-value pair to the HashTable.
- `remove`: Remove a key-value pair from the HashTable.
- `get`: Retrieve the value associated with a given key.
- `getAll`: Retrieve all elements in the HashTable.
- `update`: Update the value associated with a given key.
