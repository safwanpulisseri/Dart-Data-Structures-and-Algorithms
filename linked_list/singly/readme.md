# Singly Linked List in Dart

## Overview

Welcome to the "Singly Linked List in Dart" section of our Dart Data Structures and Algorithms repository! In this section, we explore the implementation and usage of a singly linked list, a fundamental data structure in computer science.

## Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains a data element and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. This simple, linear structure facilitates easy traversal from the head to the tail of the list.

### Node

The `Node` class is used to represent individual nodes in the linked list. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.

### Singly Linked List Representation

The `LinkedList` class encapsulates the logic for creating and manipulating the linked list. It includes operations such as adding nodes, displaying the list, removing elements, and more.

## Operations in `singly_linked_list.dart`:

- **Adding Nodes:** The `addNode` method adds a new node to the end of the list.

- **Displaying the List:** The `display` method prints the elements of the list from the head to the tail.

- **Removing the Head:** The `headRemove` method removes the head (first node) of the list.

- **Removing the Tail:** The `tailRemove` method removes the tail (last node) of the list.

- **Removing by Data:** The `removeElement` method removes a node with a specific data value from the list.

- **Inserting After a Node:** The `insertAt` method inserts a new node with given data after a node with a specified data value.

- **Inserting Before a Node:** The `insertAtPrev` method inserts a new node with given data before a node with a specified data value.

- **Adding List Elements to Another List:** The `inertToList` method appends the elements of the list to an existing list.

- **Reversing the List:** The `reverse` method reverses the order of nodes in the list.

- **Deleting a Node at a Specific Position:** The `deletePosition` method deletes a node at a specified position in the list.
