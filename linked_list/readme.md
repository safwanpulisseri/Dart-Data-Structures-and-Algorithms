# Linked List in Dart

## Overview

Welcome to the "Linked List in Dart" section of our Dart Data Structures and Algorithms repository! In this section, we explore the theory and concepts of linked lists, a fundamental data structure in computer science.

## Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists provide dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

## Node

A node in a linked list is a fundamental building block. It contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. In a doubly linked list, each node also has a link to the previous node.

### Singly Linked List

In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the sequence. It is a straightforward and memory-efficient structure.

You can find the implementation of the singly linked list in the `singly` folder.

### Doubly Linked List

In a doubly linked list, each node has links to both the next and the previous nodes in the sequence. This allows for more flexibility but requires additional memory.

You can find the implementation of the doubly linked list in the `doubly` folder.
