# Stack in Dart

## Overview

Welcome to the "Stack in Dart" section of our Dart Data Structures and Algorithms repository! In this section, we explore the implementation and usage of a Stack, a fundamental data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

## Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks are widely used in programming, providing an efficient way to manage function calls, handle expressions, and solve various problems.

## Stack Representation

The `Stack` class encapsulates the logic for creating and manipulating the stack. It includes the following operations:

### Stack Class

- **Push:** The `push` method adds a new element to the top of the stack.

- **Pop:** The `pop` method removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.

- **PeekAll:** The `peekAll` method displays all elements in the stack.

- **Insert At Bottom:** The `insertAtBottom` method inserts an element at the bottom of the stack using recursion.

- **Reverse:** The `reverse` method recursively reverses the stack.

- **New Add:** The `newAdd` method reverses the stack using the `reverse` method.

- **New Find All:** The `newFindAll` method displays all elements in the reversed stack.
