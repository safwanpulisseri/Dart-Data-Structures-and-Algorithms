# Double-Ended Queue (Deque) in Dart

## Overview

Welcome to the "Double-Ended Queue (Deque) in Dart" section of our Dart Data Structures and Algorithms repository! In this section, we explore the implementation and usage of a Double-Ended Queue, also known as a deque, which allows insertion and deletion of elements from both the front and the rear.

## Double-Ended Queue (Deque)

A double-ended queue, or deque, is a versatile data structure that supports operations on both ends. It combines the features of both stacks and queues, allowing elements to be added or removed from the front or the rear.

### Node

The `Node` class is used to represent individual nodes in the deque. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.

### Deque Implementation

The `Deque` class encapsulates the logic for creating and manipulating the deque. It includes operations such as `enqueueFront` (adding elements to the front), `enqueueBack` (adding elements to the rear), `dequeueFront` (removing elements from the front), `dequeueBack` (removing elements from the rear), and `peekAll` (displaying all elements).

## Operations in `double_ended_queue.dart`:

- **Enqueue Front (Add to Front):** The `enqueueFront` method adds a new element to the front of the deque.

- **Enqueue Back (Add to Rear):** The `enqueueBack` method adds a new element to the rear of the deque.

- **Dequeue Front (Remove from Front):** The `dequeueFront` method removes the element from the front of the deque.

- **Dequeue Back (Remove from Rear):** The `dequeueBack` method removes the element from the rear of the deque.

- **Peek All:** The `peekAll` method displays all elements in the deque.
