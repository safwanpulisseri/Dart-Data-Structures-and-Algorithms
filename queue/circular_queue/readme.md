# Circular Queue in Dart

## Overview

Welcome to the "Circular Queue in Dart" section of our Dart Data Structures and Algorithms repository! In this section, we explore the implementation and usage of a Circular Queue, a variant of the classic queue data structure.

## Circular Queue

A circular queue is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in a circular manner. In a circular queue, the last element is connected to the first element to form a circle. This allows efficient utilization of space and supports both enqueue (addition) and dequeue (removal) operations.

### Node

The `Node` class represents individual nodes in the circular queue. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.

### Circular Queue Implementation

The `CircularQueue` class encapsulates the logic for creating and manipulating the circular queue. It includes operations such as `enque` (adding elements) and `dequeue` (removing elements from the front), and `peek` (displaying the front element).

## Operations in `circular_queue.dart`:

- **Enque (Add):** The `enque` method adds a new element to the circular queue.

- **Dequeue (Remove):** The `dequeue` method removes the element from the front of the circular queue.

- **Peek:** The `peek` method displays the front element of the circular queue.
