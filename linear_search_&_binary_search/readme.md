# Searching Algorithms in Dart

## Overview

Welcome to the "Searching Algorithms in Dart" section of our Dart Data Structures and Algorithms repository! In this section, we explore two fundamental search algorithms: Binary Search and Linear Search. Both approaches are essential for finding elements efficiently in different scenarios.

## Binary Search

### Overview

Binary Search is an efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search space in half, comparing the target element to the middle element of the array. This process continues until the target element is found or the search space is empty.

### Implementation

The Dart implementation of Binary Search can be found in the `binary_search.dart` file. It utilizes a while loop to iteratively narrow down the search space until the target element is located.

## Linear Search

### Overview

Linear Search is a straightforward search algorithm that checks each element in a sequence until the target element is found or the end of the sequence is reached. While less efficient than Binary Search on sorted arrays, Linear Search is applicable to unsorted arrays.

### Implementation

The Dart implementation of Linear Search can be found in the `linear_search.dart` file. It uses a simple loop to iterate through the array and locate the target element.
