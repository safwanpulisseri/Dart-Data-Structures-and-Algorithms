# List Operations in Dart

## Introduction

Welcome to the "List Operations in Dart" section of our Dart Data Structures and Algorithms repository! Here, we explore the versatile world of lists in Dart, providing an extensive guide and problem-solving resources.

## List Representation in Dart

```dart
List<int> myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

In this example, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is a list literal, and `myList` is a variable of type `List<int>` holding this list.

## List Characteristics

Lists in Dart are dynamic collections that can hold elements of any data type. They provide flexibility and efficiency, serving as fundamental structures in programming.
