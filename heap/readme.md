# MaxHeap and MinHeap Implementation in Dart

## Overview

Welcome to the "Heap Implementation in Dart" section of our Dart Data Structures and Algorithms repository! In this section, we explore the implementation of MaxHeap and MinHeap using the Dart programming language. Heaps are fundamental data structures that facilitate efficient operations on a collection of elements, allowing quick access to the maximum or minimum value.

## Heap Concepts

### What is a Heap?

A heap is a binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a MaxHeap, the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children, and in a MinHeap, the value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children.

### MaxHeap Implementation

The `MaxHeap` class represents a MaxHeap and supports the following operations:

- `insert`: Insert elements into the MaxHeap and maintain the heap property.
- `remove`: Remove the maximum value from the MaxHeap and reorganize the heap.
- `heapifyUp`: Move an element up the heap to maintain the heap property.
- `heapifyDown`: Move an element down the heap to maintain the heap property.

### MinHeap Implementation

The `MinHeap` class represents a MinHeap and supports similar operations as the MaxHeap:

- `insert`: Insert elements into the MinHeap and maintain the heap property.
- `remove`: Remove the minimum value from the MinHeap and reorganize the heap.
- `heapifyUp`: Move an element up the heap to maintain the heap property.
- `heapifyDown`: Move an element down the heap to maintain the heap property.

## Usage Examples

### MaxHeap Example

```dart
void main() {
  MaxHeap maxHeap = MaxHeap();
  maxHeap.insert([21, 3, 19, 5, 6]);
  maxHeap.remove();
  print(maxHeap.heap); // Output: [19, 6, 21, 5]
}
```

### MinHeap Example

```dart
void main() {
  MinHeap minHeap = MinHeap();
  minHeap.insert([21, 3, 19, 5, 6]);
  minHeap.remove();
  print(minHeap.heap); // Output: [5, 6, 19, 21]
}
```
