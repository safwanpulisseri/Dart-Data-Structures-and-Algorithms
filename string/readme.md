# String Operations in Dart

## Introduction

Welcome to the "String Operations in Dart" section of our Data Structures and Algorithms repository! Here, we delve into the intricate world of string manipulation in Dart, offering a comprehensive guide and problem-solving resources.

## String Representation in Dart

```dart
String myString = "Hello, World!";
```

In this example, `"Hello, World!"` serves as a string literal, and `myString` is a variable of type `String` holding this string.

## String Characteristics

Strings in Dart are versatile, accommodating letters, numbers, symbols, or any combination of characters. They play a pivotal role in representing textual information in programs.

## Operations on Strings

Explore various operations on strings:

- **Concatenation:**

  ```dart
  String greeting = "Hello";
  String name = "John";
  String message = greeting + " " + name; // "Hello John"
  ```

- **String Interpolation:**

  ```dart
  String fullMessage = "$greeting $name"; // "Hello John"
  ```

- **Length:**

  ```dart
  int length = message.length; // 11
  ```

- **Substring Extraction:**

  ```dart
  String sub = message.substring(6); // "John"
  ```

- **Searching:**

  ```dart
  bool containsHello = message.contains("Hello"); // true
  ```
